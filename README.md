# Product Vision Statement

* ML client
    * Allow users to use the camera to play a game of rock paper scissors with the computer.
* Web App
    * Displays the results and the moves of each rock paper scissor game played on the ML client.
* DB
    * Stores the rounds of each game of rock paper scissor played on the ML client.

# Run the app

Please start the web app and database before running the ML client.<br>

The ML client use packages not supported on **Apple silicon machine**, so our app does not work on Apple silicon Mac.

## Run the web app and database

Download Docker Desktop.[link](https://www.docker.com/)

Inside the directory of the project
```
docker-compose up
```

## Run the ML Client

Look at [README.md](./machine-learning-client) file.

# Test the app locally
* Look at [README.md](./machine-learning-client/tests) file for steps to test the machine-learning-client.
* Look at [README.md](./web-app/tests) file for steps to test the web-app.

# Other Links
* How to run the web-app without docker:
    * Look at [README.md](./web-app) file.
